# Gmail API Setup - Final Step

## Current Status: âœ… OAuth Working, Gmail API Disabled

Your OAuth authentication is now working perfectly! I can see from the logs that the user successfully completed the OAuth flow and received Google tokens. 

However, the Gmail API needs to be enabled to send email invitations.

## Error Analysis
```
Gmail API has not been used in project 656494945970 before or it is disabled. 
Enable it by visiting https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/gmail.googleapis.com/overview?project=656494945970
```

## Quick Fix - Enable Gmail API

### 1. Enable Gmail API
**Click this direct link to enable Gmail API:**
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/gmail.googleapis.com/overview?project=656494945970

1. Click the **"Enable"** button
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for the API to activate
3. The page should show "API Enabled"

### 2. Verify Other APIs (Optional)
While you're there, you can also verify these APIs are enabled:
- Google Drive API
- Google Sheets API (if planning to use)
- People API (for contact management)

### 3. Test Email Invitations
After enabling Gmail API:
1. Go back to your ProjectFlow app
2. Try inviting a team member again
3. Email should send successfully via Gmail

## Success Indicators
Once Gmail API is enabled, you should see:
- âœ… "Email invitation sent successfully" message
- âœ… Actual Gmail email received by invited user
- âœ… No more 403 Gmail API errors in console

## Your OAuth Implementation is Complete!
The platform-managed OAuth system is working perfectly:
- âœ… Authentication flow complete
- âœ… Google tokens received and stored
- âœ… All scopes approved by user
- ðŸ”§ Just need Gmail API enabled for email functionality

This confirms the zero-configuration OAuth approach is successful!
