# Gmail Scope Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified ✅
The Gmail scope check was failing with 403 "insufficient authentication scopes" even though:
- OAuth tokens were successfully obtained with `gmail.send` scope
- Email sending was working correctly 
- Tokens included the required Gmail scope

## Root Cause
The scope verification was using `https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/profile` which requires **read** access to Gmail, but our OAuth only requests **send** access (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`).

## Solution Implemented ✅

### Before (Failing):
```javascript
// Attempted to call Gmail profile API (requires read scope)
const response = await fetch('https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/profile', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});
hasGmailScope = response.ok; // Always false - insufficient permissions
```

### After (Working):
```javascript
// Check scope string directly from stored token
const tokenScopes = req.session.googleTokens.scope || '';
hasGmailScope = tokenScopes.includes('https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send');
```

## Benefits
✅ **Accurate Scope Detection**: Directly checks if `gmail.send` scope is present  
✅ **No API Calls**: Avoids unnecessary Gmail API calls during scope verification  
✅ **Faster Response**: Instant scope check without network latency  
✅ **Correct Permissions**: Matches our actual OAuth scope requirements  

## Verification
The logs show successful OAuth flow with correct scopes:
```
✅ [DEV] Platform OAuth tokens successfully stored with scopes: 
openid https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email 
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile 
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
```

Email sending works correctly:
```
✅ Email invitation sent to mydomain2311@gmail.com for project "teachings.ai"
```

This fix ensures the UI correctly shows Gmail integration as available when the user has authenticated with Gmail send permissions.
